# Time-Series-Analysis-Home-Project

##Project description

The aim of the project is to compare accuracy of forecasts of prices of two cointegrated
financial instruments with: a) the VECM/VAR model and b) two independent univariate ARIMA models.

In oder to acomplish the task you should:

1. Download the csv file with time series of prices of ten financial instruments: y1, y2, . . . , y10.

2. Find one pair of cointegrated time series out of ten considered time series. Actually, there are more
than one cointegrated pair, but you are supposed to find just one of them. If you found more than one,
you could choose anyone of them.

3. Build a bivariate VECM/VAR model for this pair and produce forecasts of prices of two instruments
for the out-of-sample period.

4. Find separately for two instruments the most attractive univariate ARIMA models and produce forecasts for the same out-of-sample period.

5. Compare accuracy of forecasts of prices using the ex-post forecast error measures and choose the winner
model.

6. Prepare a short report on it.
